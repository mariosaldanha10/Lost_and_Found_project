# Lost_and_Found_project

<h1><b>Introduction</h1></b>
This is a web application designed to help people report lost and found items in a college or hotel setting. The system includes user authentication, reporting of found items, and the ability to update a user's profile.

<b>Features</b>
<i>User Authentication</i>
Staff members can log into the system to report found items that were discovered within the college or hotel. This provides a level of security and ensures that only authorized users can report found items. Users who report lost items can track the status of their lost items to see if they were found.

<b>Reporting Found Items</b>
Users can report found items by providing details such as the item title, description, location, and date and time. This information is displayed to other users who may have lost similar items, which can help facilitate the return of lost items to their rightful owners. Users can also update the item information if additional details become available.

<b>User Profile Editing</b>
Users can edit their profiles to include personal information such as name, email address, and phone number. This information can be used to contact the user if their lost item is found.

To use the Lost and Found Website, follow these steps:

Log into the system as a staff member.
Report any found items by filling out the required fields.
Users who have lost similar items can view the found item information and contact the staff member if the item is a match.
Users who have lost items can track the status of their lost items to see if they were found.
Users can edit their profile information to include personal contact information.

<h1><b>Installation</b></h1>

To run a Django project that you have downloaded or forked from Github, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies: Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from the official Python and Django websites. Additionally, if the project has a requirements.txt file, you can install the project dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

Create a virtual environment: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of the project from your system's global Python environment. You can create a virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal:


- python -m venv myenv

This will create a new virtual environment named myenv.

Activate the virtual environment: Once you have created the virtual environment, activate it by running the following command in your terminal:

- source myenv/bin/activate

If you are on Windows, use the following command instead:


- myenv\Scripts\activate

Configure the project settings: Depending on the project, you may need to configure the settings.py file with your local settings such as the database configuration, static files path, etc.

Run migrations: If the project has a database, you need to run migrations to create the necessary tables. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


- python manage.py migrate
Run the development server: Finally, you can run the development server by running the following command in your terminal:


- python manage.py runserver
This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can open this URL in your web browser to see the project.

That's it! Now you can explore the Django project you have downloaded or forked from Github.
